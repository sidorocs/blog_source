Hello there,

I'm Mathieu (sometimes known as Sidorocs on social media), and I'm 22 years old. I've recently graduated from the University of Grenoble Alpes, where I completed a Master's degree in "Cybersecurity and Legal Informatics."

I started learning cybersecurity a little over a year and a half ago, and Iâ€™ve become deeply passionate about it. I spend most of my time developing new skills on CTF platforms such as Root-Me and Hack The Box (mainly). I also participate in CTFs, usually on my own, and occasionally create challenges! I'm still actively involved in the organization of Securimag (the university's infosec association), where I give talks and help organize CTFs.

On this page, you'll find links to my social media and CTF platforms, write-ups for the challenges I've created, and presentations from my talks.
